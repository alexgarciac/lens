The contribution of non-nutritive and metabolic signals in regulating feeding is unclear. Here we show that enteric neurons play a major role in regulating feeding through specialized mechanosensory ion channels in  Drosophila. Modulating activities of a specific subset of enteric neurons, the posterior enteric neurons (PENs), results in sixfold changes in food intake. Deficiency of the mechanosensory ion channel  PPK1 gene or RNAi knockdown of its expression in the PENS result in a similar increase in food intake, which can be rescued by expression of wild-type  PPK1 in the same neurons. Finally, pharmacological inhibition of the mechanosensory ion channel phenocopies the result of genetic interrogation. Together, our study provides the first molecular genetic evidence that mechanosensory ion channels in the enteric neurons are involved in regulating feeding, offering an enticing alternative to current therapeutic strategy for weight control.</p><p id="p_19b3214c2d086eaf2a604c09a28016e2">DOI:  http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04402.001</p><h1 id="heading_779741403d6b3fcd0ec4ff10d5ed3cc2">Introduction</h1><p id="p_76a07dc03397669370dbde3d15143860">Historically, the sensation of fullness has been documented as far back as Homer's  Odyssey. Pioneering work by Cannon and Washburn revealed a correlation between stomach expansion and satiety in humans (Cannon and Washburn, 1911), which was later confirmed in rodents (<cite id="bib_item_citation_31f1876b0aaaa08e8acb7bea5d9e28ea" data-rid="bib_ae48ae06ec82297ab01be02a7a3e50d4" data-rtype="bib"></cite>).

Previous work by Miguel-Aliaga and colleagues revealed that silencing  Ilp7-Gal4 neurons increases defecation (<cite id="bib_item_citation_f39689429883d5a81e017b8ee9480025" data-rid="bib_1528845e0e183c53429c5e0b09aae0d7" data-rtype="bib"></cite>), which could be the result of increased feeding. We therefore examined the hypothesis that the activities of the PENs regulate food intake. Consistent with the hypothesis, we silenced the PENs in the absence of food and found that this abolished the gains in glucose levels (Figure 1E). We next investigated this directly using the capillary feeding assay (<cite id="bib_item_citation_5dbfe439b0182dc3ac3c330328366bd4" data-rid="bib_28900623a72d83d2842ad7e82dd656ee" data-rtype="bib"></cite>). Silencing the PENs dramatically increased food intake (<cite id="image_figure_citation_df88a5a7e84f794eb231f03f9c93ac1d" data-rid="image_figure_3bbfc523e06f0e7bde371945ba74c066" data-rtype="image_figure"></cite>A), which is consistent with the gains in glucose levels seen earlier. Conversely, activating these neurons caused dramatic decreases in feeding (<cite id="image_figure_citation_58f4e449bc920bd564331e440b177df3" data-rid="image_figure_3bbfc523e06f0e7bde371945ba74c066" data-rtype="image_figure"></cite>B). Together, manipulation of the activities of the PENs results in an overall six-fold change in feeding in comparison to the controls. This change is significantly larger than alterations by modulation of neuropeptide F signaling (<cite id="bib_item_citation_82a8bef73e06edba5c2afee87e59e97e" data-rid="bib_758226d6b56520c08161b10489efd568" data-rtype="bib"></cite>).

To determine whether the role of the PENs in feeding is related to mechanosensing activity, we first examined the projections of these neurons and found that they tightly wrap around the muscle layer rather than projecting into the lumen of the gut (<cite id="image_figure_citation_95727608e8cb16d0673eefc6854cdd05" data-rid="image_figure_3bbfc523e06f0e7bde371945ba74c066" data-rtype="image_figure"></cite>C).

Mutants of the  C. elegans DEG/ENaC  Mec-4 and its  Drosophila homolog,  PPK1, are touch-insensitive and the affected neurons fail to generate action potentials in response to mechanic tension (<cite id="bib_item_citation_6c46419e6730a6f3970a249e2319f285" data-rid="bib_4f87d094db2f58192d8518573c807dec bib_b37a3b4d16c18bf697eb104db61c6d25 bib_528542eca3cdde2ab49cb3f662642d08" data-rtype="bib"></cite>). This raised the possibility that  PPK1 could be involved in regulating feeding in the PENs. We thus examined  PPK1 expression using  PPK1-Gal4 driving mCD8::GFP and confirmed its presence in the PENs (<cite id="image_figure_citation_32aa4ea097d3a9d4c3df867b86269a69" data-rid="image_figure_3bbfc523e06f0e7bde371945ba74c066" data-rtype="image_figure"></cite>D). To test whether the function of  PPK1 in the PENs is involved in the regulation of feeding, we first assayed the effect of RNAi knockdown of  PPK1 expression (Ilp7-Gal4 or HGN1-Gal4//UAS-PPK1-RNAi). Knockdown of  PPK1 in the PENs, but not knockdown of  PPK29, a related family member (<cite id="bib_item_citation_6edeed869f5e7a97dd99d2e10bff2a11" data-rid="bib_19f0d278e57ebab9c45747c046a260ba" data-rtype="bib"></cite>), dramatically increased feeding (<cite id="image_figure_citation_55983d42a8b47a9ad14262cc261d0b05" data-rid="image_figure_3bbfc523e06f0e7bde371945ba74c066" data-rtype="image_figure"></cite>E), phenocopying the effects of silencing these neurons. Next, we examined the effect of  PPK1 deficiency on feeding and found that  PPK1 deficient flies have incrhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0960-9822(03)00596-7eased food intake (<cite id="image_figure_citation_bb8273530893a0d3cb8fe87e168d238c" data-rid="image_figure_3bbfc523e06f0e7bde371945ba74c066" data-rtype="image_figure"></cite>F).

Finally, pharmacological inhibitor of DEG/ENaCs, benzamil, has been used to antagonize PPK1 in  Drosophila and homologs in mice (<cite id="bib_item_citation_f59dd2f49f301b4d8479d46443eedf5a" data-rid="bib_55a059c61b98550da2ca5fec1ca21e72 bib_7a5cb466f93282d9ff6ad6fb7c649cf4" data-rtype="bib"></cite>). We therefore investigated the effect of benzamil on feeding and found it increased food consumption when supplemented in fly food, but not in flies where  PPK1 is knocked down (<cite id="image_figure_citation_b085323343ad1b65b9ea94beaa1bfab2" data-rid="image_figure_3bbfc523e06f0e7bde371945ba74c066" data-rtype="image_figure"></cite>G).

Enteric DEG/ENaCs provide an attractive alternative for drug development due to their druggability, pharmacological accessibility, and fewer side-effect complications than the central nervous system.
