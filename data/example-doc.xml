The contribution of non-nutritive and metabolic signals in regulating feeding is unclear. Here we show that enteric neurons play a major role in regulating feeding through specialized mechanosensory ion channels in  Drosophila. Modulating activities of a specific subset of enteric neurons, the posterior enteric neurons (PENs), results in sixfold changes in food intake. Deficiency of the mechanosensory ion channel  PPK1 gene or RNAi knockdown of its expression in the PENS result in a similar increase in food intake, which can be rescued by expression of wild-type  PPK1 in the same neurons. Finally, pharmacological inhibition of the mechanosensory ion channel phenocopies the result of genetic interrogation. Together, our study provides the first molecular genetic evidence that mechanosensory ion channels in the enteric neurons are involved in regulating feeding, offering an enticing alternative to current therapeutic strategy for weight control.</abstract></metadata><resources><bib data-id="10.1016/j.ydbio.2008.07.003"

Silencing of the PENs using both  Ilp7-Gal4 and  HGN1-Gal4 increased glucose levels in comparison to the controls, while no effect was observed by silencing the  GMR48A05-Gal4 and  GMR51F12-Gal4 neurons (<cite data-id="image-figure_citation_c372ce2f7ebf8531d129837c170f321b" data-rid="image-figure_48587b64ef85aa7abc0076e734e387ce" data-rtype="image-figure">​</cite>D).

Previous work by Miguel-Aliaga and colleagues revealed that silencing  Ilp7-Gal4 neurons increases defecation (<cite data-id="bib_item_citation_578ba2e3257a8019616e4586a1f1bea3" data-rid="10.1016/j.cmet.2010.12.010" data-rtype="bib">​</cite>), which could be the result of increased feeding. We therefore examined the hypothesis that the activities of the PENs regulate food intake. Consistent with the hypothesis, we silenced the PENs in the absence of food and found that this abolished the gains in glucose levels (Figure 1E). We next investigated this directly using the capillary feeding assay (<cite data-id="bib_item_citation_5a3016590328779c2a91c253679bda54" data-rid="10.1073/pnas.0702726104" data-rtype="bib">​</cite>). Silencing the PENs dramatically increased food intake (<cite data-id="image-figure_citation_8f02b33657dfb45ab13f5a7c1dbf3907" data-rid="image-figure_3bbfc523e06f0e7bde371945ba74c066" data-rtype="image-figure">​</cite>A), which is consistent with the gains in glucose levels seen earlier. Conversely, activating these neurons caused dramatic decreases in feeding (<cite data-id="image-figure_citation_24c9d5f97395268700b9cb9138cc918b" data-rid="image-figure_3bbfc523e06f0e7bde371945ba74c066" data-rtype="image-figure">​</cite>B). Together, manipulation of the activities of the PENs results in an overall six-fold change in feeding in comparison to the controls.

To determine whether the role of the PENs in feeding is related to mechanosensing activity, we first examined the projections of these neurons and found that they tightly wrap around the muscle layer rather than projecting into the lumen of the gut (<cite data-id="image-figure_citation_27036f546c52e6a241dc5104d3b880cf" data-rid="image-figure_3bbfc523e06f0e7bde371945ba74c066" data-rtype="image-figure">​</cite>C).

This raised the possibility that  PPK1 could be involved in regulating feeding in the PENs. We thus examined  PPK1 expression using  PPK1-Gal4 driving mCD8::GFP and confirmed its presence in the PENs (<cite data-id="image-figure_citation_7d218669a2b7ad2d7fefb71f95d2ef03" data-rid="image-figure_3bbfc523e06f0e7bde371945ba74c066" data-rtype="image-figure">​</cite>D). To test whether the function of  PPK1 in the PENs is involved in the regulation of feeding, we first assayed the effect of RNAi knockdown of  PPK1 expression (Ilp7-Gal4 or HGN1-Gal4//UAS-PPK1-RNAi). Knockdown of  PPK1 in the PENs, but not knockdown of  PPK29, a related family member (<cite data-id="bib_item_citation_6a593a9c607b2661302710d75ce82b2e" data-rid="10.1016/j.cell.2012.03.045" data-rtype="bib">​</cite>), dramatically increased feeding (<cite data-id="image-figure_citation_88f62730fcacc1e6ededdb25893b2d89" data-rid="image-figure_3bbfc523e06f0e7bde371945ba74c066" data-rtype="image-figure">​</cite>E), phenocopying the effects of silencing these neurons.

Enteric DEG/ENaCs provide an attractive alternative for drug development due to their druggability, pharmacological accessibility, and fewer side-effect complications than the central nervous system.
