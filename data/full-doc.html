      <p id="p_669fa938471b558716198fca324aa0f4">Regulation of food intake is fundamental to energy homeostasis in animals. The contribution of non-nutritive and metabolic signals in regulating feeding is unclear. Here we show that enteric neurons play a major role in regulating feeding through specialized mechanosensory ion channels in  Drosophila. Modulating activities of a specific subset of enteric neurons, the posterior enteric neurons (PENs), results in sixfold changes in food intake. Deficiency of the mechanosensory ion channel  PPK1 gene or RNAi knockdown of its expression in the PENS result in a similar increase in food intake, which can be rescued by expression of wild-type  PPK1 in the same neurons. Finally, pharmacological inhibition of the mechanosensory ion channel phenocopies the result of genetic interrogation. Together, our study provides the first molecular genetic evidence that mechanosensory ion channels in the enteric neurons are involved in regulating feeding, offering an enticing alternative to current therapeutic strategy for weight control.</p>

      <p id="p_76a07dc03397669370dbde3d15143860">Historically, the sensation of fullness has been documented as far back as Homer's  Odyssey. Pioneering work by Cannon and Washburn revealed a correlation between stomach expansion and satiety in humans (Cannon and Washburn, 1911), which was later confirmed in rodents (<cite id="bib_item_citation_842e85a96fa19b073c7bff79bc8c67c6" data-rid="bib_ae48ae06ec82297ab01be02a7a3e50d4" typeof="bib"></cite>). Recently, several groups have shown that feeding-related neurons are sensitive to satiety state but not nutrients in  Drosophila (<cite id="bib_item_citation_aeeee12fbec7cd8daa7e194964fb412c" data-rid="bib_0e12a6e929e66a852e38a993edb7dc14 bib_2967f42da616427a42534aa1bfc01afe bib_f4ef0fa9188fb532aaf4df7060218910" typeof="bib"></cite>). These studies argue that non-metabolic inputs such as mechanic tension could regulate feeding.</p>

      <p id="p_4f07844f7fd9cae4e2883ecaa4412ef0">Recent studies in  Drosophila have identified neuronal regulation of food intake and nutrient sensing in the central nervous system (<cite id="bib_item_citation_d07e8cd2ecad17e915127ea64525ada0" data-rid="bib_0e12a6e929e66a852e38a993edb7dc14 bib_2967f42da616427a42534aa1bfc01afe" typeof="bib"></cite>). However, the potential contribution of the enteric neurons in the gastrointestinal tract has not been explored. To investigate this, we utilized four previously characterized  Gal4 lines that are expressed in enteric neurons in the different parts of the  Drosophila digestive system (<cite id="image_figure_citation_335b519d756b19175a909e8bf9e482a2" data-rid="image_figure_48587b64ef85aa7abc0076e734e387ce" typeof="fig"></cite>A,B). While the  GMR48A05-Gal4 neurons project to the proventriculus and the anterior midgut, the  GMR51F12-Gal4 neurons project to the anterior midgut and the crop (<cite id="image_figure_citation_8c65e579e18fdbf7f50908fe0cfe2e85" data-rid="image_figure_48587b64ef85aa7abc0076e734e387ce" typeof="fig"></cite>A,B) (<cite id="bib_item_citation_b231ef28ea47d01504e7b7cbb578be78" data-rid="bib_364991751c31b385b2ae4892d46f4ced" typeof="bib"></cite>). In contrast, both  HGN1-Gal4 and  Ilp7-Gal4 neurons project to two posterior regions in the gut: (1) the hindgut pylorus and the connecting posterior midgut and anterior hindgut, and (2) the rectum pylorus and the rectum (referred to as the posterior enteric neurons or the PENs,  <cite id="image_figure_citation_60093c7c7d0be4b01faf2297aa59c520" data-rid="image_figure_48587b64ef85aa7abc0076e734e387ce" typeof="fig"></cite>A,B) (<cite id="bib_item_citation_19e4686f9c5c7a41d002283083a66bb0" data-rid="bib_1528845e0e183c53429c5e0b09aae0d7" typeof="bib"></cite>).</p>

      <p id="p_d8976e5a5d8fb2546c729fc88ec622fc">We first used these  Gal4 lines to activate specific enteric neurons by expressing the temperature-sensitive ion channel, TRPA1, and measured the effects on hemolymph glucose levels (UAS-TRPA1 [<cite id="bib_item_citation_02923d80d29e6432069f3e9b036f1c7a" data-rid="bib_6a7f5bd20baf433ea992551258fa5baa" typeof="bib"></cite>]). Activation of the  Ilp7-Gal4 neurons significantly decreases glucose levels in comparison to the  Ilp7-Gal4 and  UAS-TRPA1 controls (<cite id="image_figure_citation_3a552b55084f1b8c2ad4ba4eccdd206a" data-rid="image_figure_48587b64ef85aa7abc0076e734e387ce" typeof="fig"></cite>C). Since  Ilp7-Gal4 is also expressed in the CNS and in neurons projecting to the reproductive organs (<cite id="bib_item_citation_6f168452245dab91acfadfbd2740c0e1" data-rid="bib_5471719ddfdbb037bc7b58e270a754f4" typeof="bib"></cite>), we did similar experiment using  HGN1-Gal4, which expresses in the PENSs, but not in the other  Ilp7-Gal4 neurons (<cite id="bib_item_citation_5fcc9514888207a9e9fc0d88532d9c61" data-rid="bib_1528845e0e183c53429c5e0b09aae0d7" typeof="bib"></cite>), and obtained similar results on glucose levels (<cite id="image_figure_citation_8c5980a4498cd8841c0d2d188aea470c" data-rid="image_figure_48587b64ef85aa7abc0076e734e387ce" typeof="fig"></cite>C). We next examined enteric neurons projecting to other regions of the digestive system using  GMR48A05-Gal4 and  GMR51F12-Gal4 and did not observe any obvious effect (<cite id="image_figure_citation_a81b26ec83157c69a65ed4eb090afe53" data-rid="image_figure_48587b64ef85aa7abc0076e734e387ce" typeof="fig"></cite>C). We then assayed the effects of silencing these neurons by expressing the temperature-sensitive Dynamin,  ShiTS1 (UAS-ShiTS1 [<cite id="bib_item_citation_ee7cf4e0b464f1dadbb2a6a436c38f52" data-rid="bib_e9ba908494ba4a790918afaa56d97da4" typeof="bib"></cite>]). Silencing of the PENs using both  Ilp7-Gal4 and  HGN1-Gal4 increased glucose levels in comparison to the controls, while no effect was observed by silencing the  GMR48A05-Gal4 and  GMR51F12-Gal4 neurons (<cite id="image_figure_citation_3c28a32d25c88a4783aa3ecbbfda6b23" data-rid="image_figure_48587b64ef85aa7abc0076e734e387ce" typeof="fig"></cite>D). Together, the data indicate that activities of the PENs are integral in the regulation of hemolymph glucose levels.</p>
      <p id="p_83fe35b1f082618f38cabecf52ebe5e6">The change of glucose levels could result from differences in food intake. Previous work by Miguel-Aliaga and colleagues revealed that silencing  Ilp7-Gal4 neurons increases defecation (<cite id="bib_item_citation_5e3186b0d3e2eacd6259fd765fc34349" data-rid="bib_1528845e0e183c53429c5e0b09aae0d7" typeof="bib"></cite>), which could be the result of increased feeding. We therefore examined the hypothesis that the activities of the PENs regulate food intake. Consistent with the hypothesis, we silenced the PENs in the absence of food and found that this abolished the gains in glucose levels (Figure 1E). We next investigated this directly using the capillary feeding assay (<cite id="bib_item_citation_96f0878170fb5c7f35f8a965c23ef7cd" data-rid="bib_28900623a72d83d2842ad7e82dd656ee" typeof="bib"></cite>). Silencing the PENs dramatically increased food intake (<cite id="image_figure_citation_e8aab8074de35c75636935792ebd7626" data-rid="image_figure_3bbfc523e06f0e7bde371945ba74c066" typeof="fig"></cite>A), which is consistent with the gains in glucose levels seen earlier. Conversely, activating these neurons caused dramatic decreases in feeding (<cite id="image_figure_citation_64b89f5d070ad5fbd35f73839e0a419b" data-rid="image_figure_3bbfc523e06f0e7bde371945ba74c066" typeof="fig"></cite>B). Together, manipulation of the activities of the PENs results in an overall six-fold change in feeding in comparison to the controls. This change is significantly larger than alterations by modulation of neuropeptide F signaling (<cite id="bib_item_citation_2ea817ee7e4be6456239481149d68eaa" data-rid="bib_758226d6b56520c08161b10489efd568" typeof="bib"></cite>). These data indicate that the activities of the PENs play a prominent role in feeding.</p>
      <div id="include_c54fbdccf32834be92afb34c6e8e0148" typeof="include" data-rid="image_figure_3bbfc523e06f0e7bde371945ba74c066"></div>
      <p id="p_0131df80923a9031e5d8d51b2cfde373">As described above, experiments in mammals indicated that mechanic tension in the gastrointestinal tract could be a satiety signal (Cannon and Washburn, 1911;  <cite id="bib_item_citation_0f177fcb08ba88218444efd37e8cbd58" data-rid="bib_ae48ae06ec82297ab01be02a7a3e50d4" typeof="bib"></cite>). To determine whether the role of the PENs in feeding is related to mechanosensing activity, we first examined the projections of these neurons and found that they tightly wrap around the muscle layer rather than projecting into the lumen of the gut (<cite id="image_figure_citation_d08181ae399f75329ed9ec084be67670" data-rid="image_figure_3bbfc523e06f0e7bde371945ba74c066" typeof="fig"></cite>C). This anatomy favors an involvement of mechanosensory activity rather than in detecting nutritional signals in gastrointestinal tract.</p>
      <p id="p_afd1d7118b24b34cfd88a92d89f483c5">Previous studies in  Caenorhabditis elegans,  Drosophila, and mice have shown that members of the Degenerin/Epithelial Sodium Channels (DEG/ENaCs) function as a conserved family of mechanosensory ion channels (<cite id="bib_item_citation_78c46662c001a219839a731954a1dbc7" data-rid="bib_4f87d094db2f58192d8518573c807dec bib_b37a3b4d16c18bf697eb104db61c6d25 bib_528542eca3cdde2ab49cb3f662642d08" typeof="bib"></cite>). Mutants of the  C. elegans DEG/ENaC  Mec-4 and its  Drosophila homolog,  PPK1, are touch-insensitive and the affected neurons fail to generate action potentials in response to mechanic tension (<cite id="bib_item_citation_b05a66df471a8cfdde16d80426a1baf4" data-rid="bib_4f87d094db2f58192d8518573c807dec bib_b37a3b4d16c18bf697eb104db61c6d25 bib_528542eca3cdde2ab49cb3f662642d08" typeof="bib"></cite>). This raised the possibility that  PPK1 could be involved in regulating feeding in the PENs. We thus examined  PPK1 expression using  PPK1-Gal4 driving mCD8::GFP and confirmed its presence in the PENs (<cite id="image_figure_citation_21610bd3c788fa4dd15aabe8128cba36" data-rid="image_figure_3bbfc523e06f0e7bde371945ba74c066" typeof="fig"></cite>D). To test whether the function of  PPK1 in the PENs is involved in the regulation of feeding, we first assayed the effect of RNAi knockdown of  PPK1 expression (Ilp7-Gal4 or HGN1-Gal4//UAS-PPK1-RNAi). Knockdown of  PPK1 in the PENs, but not knockdown of  PPK29, a related family member (<cite id="bib_item_citation_77eead00c646b04f84defcbfddd21e6d" data-rid="bib_19f0d278e57ebab9c45747c046a260ba" typeof="bib"></cite>), dramatically increased feeding (<cite id="image_figure_citation_e3385456f97715f3f73a75e21b2047ce" data-rid="image_figure_3bbfc523e06f0e7bde371945ba74c066" typeof="fig"></cite>E), phenocopying the effects of silencing these neurons. Next, we examined the effect of  PPK1 deficiency on feeding and found that  PPK1 deficient flies have incrhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0960-9822(03)00596-7eased food intake (<cite id="image_figure_citation_9d2a4002b7a1995a2bf6b9122bc20595" data-rid="image_figure_3bbfc523e06f0e7bde371945ba74c066" typeof="fig"></cite>F). This feeding defect is rescued by expressing a  PPK1 transgene in the PENs (Ilp7-Gal4, UAS- PPK1 (<cite id="bib_item_citation_49963bb281b5f714c409b549295b61bb" data-rid="bib_1cb97ecad3dd4cdb1f9fbcc8cf171f5e" typeof="bib"></cite>),  <cite id="image_figure_citation_10a5abe3da6e05e05f6b75aa58458fd5" data-rid="image_figure_3bbfc523e06f0e7bde371945ba74c066" typeof="fig"></cite>F). Finally, pharmacological inhibitor of DEG/ENaCs, benzamil, has been used to antagonize PPK1 in  Drosophila and homologs in mice (<cite id="bib_item_citation_2ccc7bd13c7623ab2c2562bb5a3d33fc" data-rid="bib_55a059c61b98550da2ca5fec1ca21e72 bib_7a5cb466f93282d9ff6ad6fb7c649cf4" typeof="bib"></cite>). We therefore investigated the effect of benzamil on feeding and found it increased food consumption when supplemented in fly food, but not in flies where  PPK1 is knocked down (<cite id="image_figure_citation_1ff80a1258ca38e90f9912dc7f57bf1e" data-rid="image_figure_3bbfc523e06f0e7bde371945ba74c066" typeof="fig"></cite>G). Together, these data indicate that the mechanosensory ion channel, PPK1, plays a critical role in the PENs for regulating feeding.</p>
      <p id="p_82cbf8e15fd8a0418c926b4455d7f0a3">The identification of the involvement of the DEG/ENaC mechanosensory ion channels in enteric neurons for regulating feeding lays the groundwork for investigating mechanisms underlying the phenomenon of fullness sensation. Pharmacological interventions on appetite stimulation and suppression are important for many diseases including obesity, cancer, and AIDS. Currently, all three FDA-approved weight-loss drugs have significant side-effects that target either the hypothalamus or fat absorption (<cite id="bib_item_citation_368a5601cb331fc7f7e3b1c9d76f4421" data-rid="bib_b5a486deeb2400c94f4e23358a21af0f" typeof="bib"></cite>). Enteric DEG/ENaCs provide an attractive alternative for drug development due to their druggability, pharmacological accessibility, and fewer side-effect complications than the central nervous system. Overall, our findings indicate an important role of the DEG/ENaC mechanosensory ion channels in the enteric nervous system in food intake and suggest an exciting therapeutic alternative for fighting obesity.</p>
